Introduction
This project is a demonstration of building a RESTful API using Flask and SQLAlchemy. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of books. It provides endpoints to manage books in the database, including adding new books, retrieving book information, updating book details, and deleting books.

Features
Create a new book record.
Retrieve book details by ID.
Retrieve a list of all books.
Update existing book details.
Delete a book by ID.
Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

arduino
Copy code
BookAPI/
  |- app.py
  |- config.py
  |- models.py
  |- routes.py
  |- requirements.txt
app.py: Entry point for the Flask application.
config.py: Configuration settings for the Flask application.
models.py: Database models definition.
routes.py: API endpoints and their corresponding functions.
requirements.txt: Required Python packages for the project.
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BookAPI.git
cd BookAPI
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
bash

python app.py
The application will start running at http://localhost:5000.

Usage
Use an API testing tool like Postman to interact with the API endpoints. The available endpoints are:

GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books.
GET /books/<id>: Retrieve book details by ID.
POST /books: Create a new book record.
PUT /books/<id>: Update existing book details.
DELETE /books/<id>: Delete a book by ID.
